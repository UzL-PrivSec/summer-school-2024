# Summer School 24
Python coding exercise for privacy-preserving machine learning

## Setup
If you want to work on a specific exercise, please follow these steps:
1. Open Google Colab in your browser and sign in with your Google account.
2. Open the exercise's Jupyter notebook and upload the ```data/``` directory if necessary.
3. Select a GPU-based runtime environment from the Google Colab menu.

## Exercises
This repository contains three machine learning exercises:
- Adversarial Examples: Implement the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) to create an adversarial example.
- Membership Inference: Use loss-based membership inference attacks to infer knowledge about whether a data point was part of the training or test set.
- Private SGD: Train a neural network using DP-SGD in a privacy preserving manner.
